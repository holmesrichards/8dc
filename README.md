CV to ADC Eurorack module, inspired by Look Mum No Computer's 123ADC

Eurorack module that takes a CV and converts it to 8 gates with an ADC. Simple stuff. Starting point was Look Mum No Computer's 123ADC prototype. Besides adding Eurorack power components I revised the input and output protections (which leaves almost nothing of LMNC's version intact except the ADC chip itself!)
